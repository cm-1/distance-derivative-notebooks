# distance-derivative-notebooks
Contains ipynb investigations of various signed distance transform (SDT) approximations
and approximations of their derivatives with respect to pose changes.

# Licensing TODO

I need to see if I can change the license to something more permissive, like 0BSD.
Should probably be fine, but there's one detail about ipynb notebooks that has
me just slightly unsure.

But my intention is that anyone can do anything they want with any code snippets
that I end up generating here. The BSD-3 is just to be safe until I resolve
the above.
